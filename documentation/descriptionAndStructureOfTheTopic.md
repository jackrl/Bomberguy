#Description and Structure of the Topic

**Topic:** The intention of this project is to make a game similar to the classic bomberman games. The player will be able to go through various levels, that have enemies and destructible blocks, with the help of bombs. The player will begin with the capability of throwing just one bomb at a time. The amount of bombs and their reach can be increased by collecting power-ups that will drop when the player destructs a destructible block.

The player will be able to advance to the next level every time he has eliminated every enemy in a certain level and found the door to the next level. There will be a few different enemies that will have differing movement patterns. There will be also a timer and score-counter. If the timer ends the player will loose a life and will be able to start the same level again. If the player looses all his lives the game will be over.

*Things that might be added after the core functionality is complete:*

1. Support for USB SNES controller
