#Description and Structure of the Topic

**Topic:** The intention of this project is to make a game similar to the classic bomberman games. The player will be able to go through a couple of levels, that have enemies and destructible blocks that can be destroyed with the help of bombs. The player will begin with the capability of throwing just one bomb at a time. The amount of bombs and their range can be increased by collecting power-ups that may drop when the player destructs a destructible block.

The player will be able to advance to the next level every time he has eliminated every enemy in a certain level. There will might be different enemies that with differing movement patterns.

*Things that might be added if there is time left:*

1. Timer and score-counter

**Users:** Player/players
		
**Features of the player/players:**
* The player can move in the 4 main directions (up, down, left and right)
* The player can throw bombs
* The player can collect power-ups
* The player can pause the game
